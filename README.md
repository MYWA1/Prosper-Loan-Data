## by (Ajanaku Olumide)


## Dataset

> This project examines the prosper dataset that contains information on 113,937 loans. The primary areas of interest are the relationships between various characteristics, such as loan status, credit rating, and borrower monthly income, and the Borrower APR (annual percentage rate) of a loan. I was able to find a link to a sheet. that had the explanations for each columns in my dataset and it was really helpful. **The Link:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0

## Summary of Findings
 
> In the exploration, I found that there was a strong positive correlation between some of the numerical features. For instance, there was the BorrowerAPR, BorrowerRate, LenderYield had a strong relationship. In addition, the LoanOriginalAmount and MonthlyLoanPayment also had a strong relationship. For the categorical features, the Credit Grade and Prosper Rating had a strong relationship.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For my presentation on the factors that influence the Borrower Rate you get when you apply for a loan. Consequently, I had to plot features that had relationships with the Borrower Rate and was able to get insights from the plot, for example, the Monthly loan payment and borrower rate plot in my presentation shows the rate assigned to those with a higher monthly loan payment is lower as opposed to whose monthly loan payment is low.
